description: >
    This is the HEAT template used for LoadCore Agents deployment in OpenStack-based environments. 
    The template will create one LoadCore Agent with one management interface, one test interface and associate one floating IP address (static).
    The LoadCore_HeatTemplate_Variables_Agent1.yaml environment file is used for hardcoding the parameters for the resources defined in this Heat Template.
