	LoadCore 4.0 is the next step in the product evolution focused mainly on consolidating CoreSIM.
	<BR>
	With this release LoadCore continues to expand in depth and in breadth in the cloud area, being validated in Oracle Cloud and Azure AKS.
    	<BR>	
	Negative testing capabilities have been added for the SBI nodes with the SBI fuzzer.
	<BR>
	On control plane the main addition is IPsec supporton the N2 and N3 interfaces, and countless other enhancements.
	<BR>
	In the user plane area, the most important addition is Capture Replay plus a lot of depth in the Video & Voice areas (e.g. Dash, Netflix)

    LoadCore 4.0 provides a new middleware image and an upgrade file. Please also note that upgrading a setup from
    pre-LC3.4 version to LC4.0 is not supported.
    <BR>
    LoadCore 3.0 also comes with new agent images, and upgrades.
    <BR>
    AWS and Azure images are not distributed on the product download page. AWS image can be found on the<a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=e47b8c97-3fd9-4c39-bd75-9bbe50f3436c"
        target="_blank"> AWS Marketplace</a>, and both (AWS and Azure) can be shared by request by the engineering team.
    Please contact engineering at email <a href="loadcore-support@keysighttech.onmicrosoft.com">LoadCore-Support</a> to
    request access to these images.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    The REST API dashboards names have been changed. For automation users, in case your harness is checking the
    statistics, please use the REST API stats migration script to automatically convert the old naming into the new one.
    <BR>



    Please follow these steps to create a setup for running the product:
    <BR>
    <H4>If a LC3.4 or 4.0 setup is not yet deployed, please use the below steps to deploy LC4.0 and configure an account
    </H4>
    <OL>
        <LI>Deploy the UI/middleware cluster OVA file</LI>
        <LI>Deploy the licensing OVA file (optional)</LI>
        <LI>After deployment you can access the UI using the MW machine IP and access it using a browser:
            https://XX.XX.XX.XX. If shortly after deploying the MW the UI is not accessible, you need to wait a couple
            of minutes for all the pods to start up.</LI>
        <LI>To access the UI, you will be prompted for a username and password. You will need to register a new user and
            then use it each time you log in.</LI>

        <LI>Connect to the LC4.0 with your account. If a LC4.0 setup is not already available please use the above steps
            to deploy a new setup</LI>
    </OL>
    <H4>If a LC3.4 setup is deployed, please use the below steps to upgrade:</H4>
    <OL>
        <H4>Apply the patch using the UI: </H4>
        <LI>After connecting to the LC3.4 setup, find the "Gear menu" in the upper right corner and click on it to bring
            up the menu</LI>
        <LI>Then, click on "Software Updates"</LI>
        <LI>Click the "Browse" button and use the opened control to find the LC4.0 upgrade tar on the disk. If the LC environment is cloud (not on premise) please use the cloud tar (LoadCore-MDW-cloud-BUILD_VERSION.tar).</LI>
        <LI>Click on the "Start Update" button to apply the patch and wait for the procedure to end. </LI>
        <LI>Refresh your LoadCore page in the broswser</LI>
        <LI>Access the same menu and check the version of the setup again to make sure that the patch has been applied
            successfully.</LI>
    </OL>
    <OL>
        <H4>Apply the patch using the KCOS CLI: </H4>
        <LI>Connect to the LC3.4 setup with either SSH (on port 22: admin/admin user) or directly through the console
            (console -> admin/admin user). This will make available the KCOS CLI.</LI>
        <LI>Copy the LC4.0 update file to the MW using SCP. (admin/admin user). If the LC environment is cloud (not on premise) please use the cloud tar (LoadCore-MDW-cloud-BUILD_VERSION.tar).</LI>
        <LI>Give the following command in the KCOS CLI pointing to the update tar that was copied on the MW machine:
            kcos deployment offline-install ./LoadCore-MDW-BUILD_VERSION.tar </LI>
        <LI>Wait for the process to finish. This might take several minutes. </LI>
        <LI>Refresh your LoadCore page in the broswser</LI>
        <LI>Access the UI and check the version of the setup to make sure that the patch has been applied successfully.
        </LI>
    </OL>


    <H4>For deploying the agents, please follow these steps:</H4>
    <OL>
        <LI>Deploy the agent OVA file</LI>
        <LI>Add another NIC to the agent VM from the hypervisor configuration window. This will be the test NIC.</LI>
        <LI>Log in to the agent VM and configure the management interface, if needed</LI>
        <LI>Run the agent-setup.sh script and follow the steps in the interactive setup. This step is required to
            connect the agent to the middleware/UI cluster.</LI>
        <PRE>#  sudo ./agent-setup.sh</PRE>
        <LI>At this point, you should be able to see the newly created agent in the UI</LI>
    </OL>
    Repeat these steps to deploy as many agents as required.
	<H4>For upgrading the agents, please follow these steps:</H4>
	<OL>
		<LI>Use the following command to install libunbound2:</LI>
		<PRE>#  sudo apt-get install libunbound2
		<LI>Apply the REST API command to update the agent (replace the IP and location of the .tgz as needed):</LI>
curl -kX PUT https://XX.XX.XX.XX/api/v1/update --upload-file /home/ixia/LoadCore-Agent-Update-BUILD_VERSION.tgz
